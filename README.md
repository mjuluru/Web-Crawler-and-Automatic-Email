# Web-Crawler-and-Automatic-Email
Python script to extract email ids from web pages and send automatic emails

DISCLAIMER: This is a personal project to facilitate sending emails to multiple professors in the university's website.
This project follows the guidelines of Web Crawling and has not displayed any personal information of the professors
extracted and is used only for educational purposes.
This project is to be used only for educational and reference purposes and not to cause harm or any form of negative impact on anyone.

MOTIVATION: 
Sending emails to the Professors asking for open opportunities to work under them.

THOUGHT PROCESS:
In order to automatically send the emails to the professors, I need the list of the email ids from the web pages on the university's website.
To extract the email ids from the web pages, I need to crawl and parse them.
So, I developed this step-by-step process to develop the script:

Step1: Setup for web crawling
Step2: Perform web crawling and parse the webpages
Step3: Setup for automatic email sending to the professors
Step4: Code to create a message
Step5: Send the emails
Step6: Close the connection
